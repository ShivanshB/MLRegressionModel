# MLRegressionModel

Model for Simple Single Variable Linear Regression Using Gradient Descent

Using the US Department of Agriculture's tree dataset with over 14,000 datapoints, I formed a regression model relating the "Diameter at Breast Height" and "Height" of these trees. An image with the resulting regression is included.
